<h2>Start your first job with {{fleetName}}</h2>

Welcome our new partner to GOJO! Be ready to receive our install call for on-demand rides or actively grab yourself available in advance-booked trips.

### 1. Instant Service
These dispatched calls will ask for your prompt response to either accept or "say no". Once you accept, the ride will start right away to head to the passenger's pick-up request.

### 2. Reserved Service
These scheduled requests (rides/long-distance trips/delivery jobs) are made in advance and stored in **Jobs/Nearby** module. Check the module regularly for these available offers and grab your desired ones!

> **Note:** Once you accept a reservation, it will go to **Jobs/Confirmed**. The pick-up time will be timely alerted to ensure you start the job punctually.
